# About Me
I'm a software engineer based in Cambridge, MA, working for Google. I was born and raised in southern New Hampshire, and attended Northeastern University for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

# My Work
I'm currently working on AI features for Google's Chrome browser. I also work on the proposed HTML [\<fencedframe\>](https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/tree/master/explainer) element. I contribute changes to Chromium and work within the Web Platform feature incubation process. 

Before that, I was working on video playback at YouTube, mostly on the C++ microservices that support playback at scale. I also dabbled in the Android video player and YouTube's CDN. 

In the past, I also worked on the Google Mobile Ads SDK for Android, as well as [Cobalt](https://cobalt.foo), an HTML5 app container for living room devices like game consoles and smart TVs.

# My Interests
When I'm not programming, I spend most of my time:

* Gaming with friends on my PC
* Playing musical instruments
* Working on my homelab (it is never done)

I'm hoping to blog about tech, games, and other topics on this site soon. When I do, I'll link the posts here!
