Hey y'all, welcome to my personal site. Yes, I am using a default Github Pages theme. No, I am not sorry.

## My Work

I'm currently working on video playback at YouTube. I primarily work on C++ web services, but I've contributed to the Android video player as well.

Previously I interned on two other teams/projects at Google:
*  The Google Mobile Ads SDK
*  [Cobalt](https://cobalt.foo), and HTML5 app container for resource-constrained devices.
