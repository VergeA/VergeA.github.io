## About Me
I'm a software engineer based in Cambridge, MA, working for Google at their office in Kendall Square. I was born and raised in southern New Hampshire, and attended Northeastern University for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

## My Work
I'm currently working on the proposed HTML [\<fencedframe\>](https://github.com/WICG/fenced-frame/tree/master/explainer) element. I contribute changes to Chromium and and work within the Web Platform feature incubation process. 

Before that, I was working on video playback at YouTube, mostly on the C++ microservices that support playback at scale. I also dabbled in the Android video player and YouTube's CDN.

In college, I interned on two other teams/projects at Google:
*  The Google Mobile Ads SDK
    *  I implemented experimental functionality on the Android version of the SDK.   
*  [Cobalt](https://cobalt.foo), an HTML5 app container for resource-constrained devices.
    *   I mostly worked on the Python tooling used to support development and testing of Cobalt across its various device targets. 

When I'm not writing code, I mentor interns during the summer.

## My Interests

Inside of programming, there are a couple of topics that I'm hoping to learn more about:
*  Compiler development/design
    *  I took a class during my undergrad in which we compiled progressively-more-complicated languages to assembly; it was some of the most challenging and rewarding work I did during my time in university, and I'd love to go further down that rabbit-hole.
*  Security
    *  Honestly, malware analysis just seems really cool.

Outside of programming, I spend most of my time:
* Playing games with friends on my PC
* Playing musical instruments
* Working on my homelab (it is never done)
