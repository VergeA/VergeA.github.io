Hey y'all, welcome to my personal site.

## About Me
I'm a software engineer based in Cambridge, MA, working for Google at their office in Kendall Square. I was born and raised in southern New Hampshire, and attended Northeastern University for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

## My Work
I'm currently working on video playback at YouTube. I primarily work on C++ web services, but I've contributed to the Android video player as well. When I'm not writing code, I mentor interns during the summer, and spend a fair amount of time staring at SQL query progress bars.

Previously I interned on two other teams/projects at Google:
*  The Google Mobile Ads SDK
    *  I implemented experimental functionality on the Android version of the SDK.   
*  [Cobalt](https://cobalt.foo), an HTML5 app container for resource-constrained devices.
    *   I mostly worked on the Python tooling used to support development and testing of Cobalt across its various device targets. 

## My Interests

Inside of programming, there are a couple of topics that I'm hoping to learn more about:
*  Compiler development/design
    *  I took a class during my undergrad in which we compiled progressively-more-complicated languages to assembly; it was some of the most challenging and rewarding work I did during my time in university, and I'd love to go further down that rabbit-hole.
*  Security
    *  Honestly, malware analysis just seems really cool.

Outside of programming, I spend most of my time:
* Playing games with friends on my PC
* Playing musical instruments
* Taking long walks in scenic parts of the city
